 ** This header file contains the typedefs and prototypes used by 
 ** solve_cell() and all its subroutines for solving a single SD problem.
 **
 ** These structures are required for each serial SD solution, but they may 
 ** be freed once a solution is obtained (whereas the cell data must be 
 ** stored for future marriages, and the prob data is always needed).
 **
 **
 ** History:
 **   17 Feb 1992 - <Jason Mai> - created from subprob.h.
 **   16 Nov 1992 - <Jason Mai> - updated documentation.

** Omega stores the set of observations which have been made so far.
 **
 **   Each observation consists of a vector of realizations of random
 ** variables with discrete distributions.  Since every distribution is
 ** discrete, an observation is just stored as a vector of indices into a 
 ** distribution array containing the possible values.  _idx_ is an array
 ** of such vectors.  Each rv occurs in the R vector or T matrix which
 ** (along with the candidate X) make up the rhs of the subproblem.  
 **
 **   The _row_ and _col_ arrays give the coordinates in R and T of each rv 
 ** realization in a vector.  If _col_ is zero for a given entry, then the
 ** realization comes from R; otherwise, it comes from T.  The field _RT_ 
 ** represents a vector of actual realizations (as opposed to indices) of 
 ** omega for both the Romega and Tomega structures (only one observation's 
 ** worth of omega). 
 ** 
 **   The _weight_ field specifies the number of times a particular outcome 
 ** has been observed (it starts at 1 when the outcome is first generated, 
 ** and increments every time the same outcome is observed again).  _cnt_ 
 ** just specifies the number of distinct outcomes which have been observed 
 ** and stored in the omega structure.  
 **
 **   If the problem gets too large, some unexciting omegas may be dropped.  
 ** So, _filter_ (same length as _weight_) describes which vectors in the 
 ** _idx_ array are actually filled with observations.  _next_ references 
 ** the place to start in the _filter_ array when trying to find the next 
 ** available position in _idx_.  _most_ represents the number of
 ** elements needed to store all elements in the _idx_ array, from
 ** the first to the last.  (It is the greatest index at which an 
 ** observation is stored in the _idx_ array, plus one).   Finally,
 ** _last_ indicates the index of omega from which we started dropping
 ** omegas last time -- so we only "need" to go from omega.most down
 ** to omega.last when dropping them this time (we'll miss some).

**   The delta matrix contains the values of lambda_pi X Romega and
 ** lambda_pi X Tomega for all values of pi and all observations of omega.  
 ** _col_ gives the column number of the each non-zero element in the 
 ** multiplication of lambda_pi X Tomega (the same elements are non-zero 
 ** each time).  _val_ is an array of vectors of (lambda_pi X Romega, 
 ** lambda_pi X Tomega) pairs of calculations.  A row in _val_ corresponds
 ** to a distinct dual vector, and a column in _val_ corresponds to a 
 ** distinct observation of omega.  Thus, every pi-omega combination is
