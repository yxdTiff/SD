 **
 ** This header file contains the prototypes and type definitions
 ** required for the solution of a problem with one or more cells.
 **
 ** Its data structures are necessary to define one cell, which contains
 ** dual vectors, cuts, and some counts for combining them.

 **
 ** History:
 **   17 Feb 1992 - <Jason Mai> - created from subprob.h.
 **   16 Nov 1992 - <Jason Mai> - updated documentation.

 ** this end, pi_R_T_type represents a single calculation of pi X R

 ** row number for a given dual variable in _val_.  _cnt_ represents

 ** for pi X Rbar and pi X Tbar, one entry for each pi.  Note that values
 ** which are always zero (because Rbar or Tbar is zero there) are not 
 ** stored.  The _lamb_ array is the same size as the _val_ array, and for

**   The current cell's long array of cuts is composed of the cuts of all 
 ** the ancestors' cells, as well as its own cuts.  The theta structure 
 ** describes all the attributes of an ancestor's cuts.  Each ancestor
 ** is represented by one element in the _last_, _k_, and _p_ arrays.
 ** The _last_ array specifies the position in this cell's cuts->val array 
 ** of the last cut belonging to an ancestor.  The _k_ array represents the 
 ** coefficient on all cuts of an ancestor due to the cumulative multiplication 
 ** by k/N when cells are married.  The _p_ field represents the original 
 ** probability of the ancestor.  The _cnt_ field simply gives the number of 
 ** ancestors (equivalently, the length of each array in theta).
 **
 **   Should theta be one long array, as before, to ease the marriage rountine?
 ** harder to reference; easier to merge...

**   In order to marry two cells together, the dual vectors and cuts
 ** from each cell must be combined, using weighting factors based
 ** on the number of samples taken in each cell and the probability 
 ** associated with each cell.  So, each cell maintains the dual
 ** vector data (_lambda_ and _sigma_), the cuts (_cuts_), and counts
 ** for weighting the cuts (_N_, _theta_, _P_).  Each cell
 ** also knows its id number as _id_num_.  _k_ represents the number 
 ** of samples taken thus far in the solution of the current cell.  
 ** 
 **   In order to generate observations from a married cell, we must
 ** know the first generation ancestors (those which once existed as 
 ** single cells) which have combined to make this cell.  The id numbers
 ** of these ancestors are stored in _members_, which is an array
 ** of length _num_members_.  When cells are running in parallel, each
 ** one should have its own copy of the master and subproblem data, so 
 ** there are no collisions or locks.  Pointers to these problems are stored
 ** in the _master_ and _subprob_ fields.
 **
 **   Should the theta structure be updated at the end of a cell's
 ** solution, or at the beginning of the married cell's solution?
 ** i.e. should num_samples (k) be stored in the cell, or later in theta?
